Sentiment analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews

This project aims to examine sentiment analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews prediting the number of positive and negative reviews using logistic regression. In this Project, we will use NLP to find the sentiment of a given movie review. Sentiment Analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative, and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques.

We will use the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset which contains a collection of 50,000 movie reviews. The dataset is split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The reviews are labeled as positive (1) or negative (0).

The objective of this project is to use logistic regression to predict the sentiment of a given movie review by training a model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the test set.
